## What I learned

- Navigation between fragments without registering icons in the NavBottomBar, achieved through the use of LiveData. This expanded my understanding of Android navigation components.
- The proper use of SharedFlow for updating data periodically via REST API within the app. This allowed me to efficiently handle data sharing among multiple collectors in a reactive programming paradigm, improving the app's responsiveness and performance.
